# Singular Value Decomposition from Scratch Lectures

3-part series for building the intuition for Singular Value Decomposition both conceptually and mathematically using the [Manim CE](https://www.manim.community/) Library to create custom visualizations for the slides.

## Objective

This project serves the purpose of a proof-of-concept that complicated mathematical and programming topics can be illustrated clearly using the Manim CE Library. Hopefully these types of visualizations can be integrated into core classes at UF (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Programming Fundamentals, etc.) where students may struggle understanding the material as is.

## Timeline

The construction of these slides is expected to be finished by the end of Spring 2022. The presentation will be given in Summer or Fall of 2022, and the recording will be posted here afterwards. Below is the lecture structure as well as some of the completed slides for the presentation.

### Updates

* 3/25/2022 - Added Github repo, the code available was made during Spring Break from 3/5/22 to 3/10/22
